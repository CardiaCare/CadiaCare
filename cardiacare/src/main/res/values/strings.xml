\n\nOur Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by CardiaCare (collectively, the "Service")  project with respect to your access and use of the website at cardiacare.ru or  mobile application CardiaCare. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service. Your privacy is important to us, so we encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide to us or is collected about you will be used.

\n\nWe\'re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and notifying you via the Service, email or some other means. Please note that if you\'ve opted not to receive emails from us, any changes to this policy that you would otherwise have been notified of through email will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

\n\nWhat Information does this Policy Cover?

\n\nAs used in this Policy, the term "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such a name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include anonymous information, nor does it include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of anonymous or aggregate information.

\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect?

\n- Clicking on the main application screen on the “Pass survey” button downloads a questionnaire with questions from the server.
\n- The survey is presented in the form of a test consisting of a series of questions with possible answers. Sometimes there are open questions in which you need to enter a response by yourself or attach a file.
\n- After passing the survey, the selected answers should be sent to the server for processing the results.
\n- To send answers, click the “Send” icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
\n- Answers sent to the server will be reviewed by the doctor.
\n- Reset the selected answers by clicking on the “Refresh” icon in the upper right corner of the screen.

\n- Before you start, you need to charge the cardiomonitor.
\n- A charged cardiomonitor is attached to a special strap.
\n- The strap with the cardiomonitor is put on the chest so that the cardiomonitor is located on the position of the solar plexus.
\n- To turn on the cardiomonitor, it needs to be shaken.
\n\nApplication settings:
\n- To connect the device to the cardiomonitor, turn on Bluetooth and press the “ECG” button.
\n- In the list of found devices, select “ECG_BELT”.
\n- If there is no device “ECG_BELT” in the list, then the cardiomonitor should be shaken again and click the “Refresh” icon in the upper right corner of the screen.
\n- When the device connects to a cardiomonitor, a cardiogram appears on the screen.
\n- Adjust the position of the strap with the cardiomonitor so that there are no abrupt jumps on the cardiogram. An example of a correct cardiogram can be found in the section “ECG Demonstration”.
\n- The ECG data is saved to files on the device.
\n- After the interval set in the account (the minimum is 1 minute, the maximum is 5 minutes, the default is 1 minute), the data file is sent to the server.
\n- If you do not have access to the Internet during ECG removal, ECG files will be stored on the user device and automatically sent to the server when connected to the Internet.
\n- After the data is sent to the server, the data files are deleted from the device.
\n- During the removal of the ECG, a widget is displayed in the notification area that displays the status of the connection to the cardiomonitor. Also on the widget are the pulse, the level of the cardiomonitor charge and the elapsed ECG removal time.
\n- With the widget, you can quickly go to the ECG removal screen. To do this, click on the “Open ECG” button or on the widget itself.
\n- Working with the cardiomonitor is available in the background. To do this, connect to the cardiomonitor and close the application.
